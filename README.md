## Project description



### 1. Data collection:

This component is responsible for scraping customer reviews from Google Shopping. Web scraping using beautiful soup and requests are used to extract product details and customet reviews


### 2. Generating Summaries and an Advertisement (Customer Modeling):

Once the reviews are collected, we create a **vector database** using pinecone python client to store the vector embeddings(hugging face) generated from reviews. After that, LangChain is used to generate a summary that highlights the most significant insights and sentiments expressed in the reviews. Here, gpt-4 LLM is used to generate summaries and Advertisement. This summary can be a valuable resource for understanding customer sentiment  based on a query related to the product and to improve marketing strategies and reach a broader audience. Here, gpt-4 model is used to generate summaries and Advertisement. One can tune the parameters to generate the output more relevant to the specific product.

### 3. Review Analytics:

An overall and comprehensive overview can be obtained with a simple click. It will also include some suggestons based on reviews to improve the respective product. This can be very useful to rectify product shortcomings and focus on improving it. 


### 4. Churn/Repeat customers:

The AI assitant can also be used to identify churn/repeat customers by just giving natural language instructions. This can be a game changer in building a POC by focusing on the qualitative unstructured data that is easily available to improve customer retention in a business.
